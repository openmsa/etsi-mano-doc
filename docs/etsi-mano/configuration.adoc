== Understading configuration

Mano module is using Spring cloud configuration.

=== Environment configuration
By default all Environment variables have precedence over all other configurations. The conversion rules are simple.
from a yaml / properties file all the key will be in upper case and all punctuation have to be replace by `_`

[source, yaml]
-----
mano:
  frontend-url:
-----
The result will be `MANO_FRONTEND_URL`

=== mano-config module
Mano-config module allow you to define a `$HOME/.mano/configuration.properties` file. This file is the same as the old
spring `.properties` files, but this file have precedence over the webapp one.

The is also a second mechanism that allow you to override some values for a given `tag`
Typically it came out of the box with 2 tags `vnfm` and `nfvo`.

[source,yaml]
-----
mano:
  config:
    folder: // <1>
    type: // <2>
-----
<1> The folder absolute path IE `/home/ncuser/.mano/`
<2> One tag for overriding the configuration keys IE: `vnfm` or `nfvo`

=== Docker swarm module
Use docker secret to override some configuration keys.
Refer to official documentation of secrets: https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/

As keys are converted to files, we need the spring flat representation of a key. This format is the correct one `mano.frontend-url`

And provide the value using the secret docker API.

[source,yaml]
-----
mano:
  config:
    docker:
      bind-path: // <1>
-----

<1> The default bind path is `/run/secrets` but you can change it using the above configuration.
