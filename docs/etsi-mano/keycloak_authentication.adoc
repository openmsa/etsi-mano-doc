== Introduction

link:https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] is used to secure the communication between the NFVO and the VNFM.

Keycloak is a single sign-on solution for web apps and RESTful web services. 
The goal of Keycloak is to make security simple so that it is easy for application developers to secure the apps and services they have deployed in their organization. 
Security features that developers normally have to write for themselves are provided out of the box and are easily tailorable to the individual requirements of your organization. 
Keycloak provides customizable user interfaces for login, registration, administration, and account management.

=== Keycloak setup and configuration

----
Keycloak service is included in the MSActivator docker stack services "mano-auth".

  mano-auth:
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
      placement:
        constraints:
          - "node.labels.worker==app"
    environment:
      KEYCLOAK_USER: admin
      KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD: ubiqube
      DB_VENDOR: postgres
      DB_ADDR: mano-db
      POSTGRES_ADDR: mano-db
      DB_USER: keycloak
      DB_PASSWORD: keycloak
      JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL: JDBC_PING
      JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROPERTIES: "datasource_jndi_name=java:jboss/datasources/KeycloakDS"
    image: jboss/keycloak
    ports:
      - target: 8080
        published: 8110
        protocol: tcp

==== Credential update

Login to the admin console with the login credentials set in the docker stack config

      KEYCLOAK_USER: admin
      KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD: ubiqube

The default credentials are admin/ubiqube.
To update the credentials, login as admin:
go to "Manage Account" (top right, under Admin)
click "signing In" and update the password

==== Realm Management
A new Realm must be created prior to be able to use the MANO modules

A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups. A user belongs to and logs into a realm. Realms are isolated from one another and can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.

When creating a realm, the following configuration must be provided:

* Realm Name : mano-realm
* Enabled: On

Once created, the realm clients must be configured:

==== Create first Client mano-nfvo
* General Settings
** Client Type: OpenID Connect
** Client ID: mano-nfvo
** Name: mano-nfvo
* Capability Config
** Client Authentication: On
** Authorization: On
* Access Settings
** Valid redirect URI: http://auth/*

==== Create a new Realm Role NFVO
Role Name: NFVO

Select the client mano-vnfm, navigate to "Service Account Roles" and click "Assign Role" to assign the Realm Role to the client

Verify that the role is listed in the Client roles

==== Create second Client mano-vnfm

* General Settings
** Client Type: OpenID Connect
** Client ID: mano-vnfm
** Name: mano-vnfm
* Capability Config
** Client Authentication: On
** Authorization: On
* Access Settings
** Valid redirect URI: http://auth/*

==== Create a new Realm Role VNFM
Role Name: VNFM

Select the client mano-vnfm, navigate to "Service Account Roles" and click "Assign Role" to assign the Realm Role to the client

Verify that the role is listed in the Client roles

==== Realm verification
For each client, copy the client secret from Client-Credential and execute the curl request as below

----
curl -X POST 'http://[IP]:8110/realms/mano-realm/protocol/openid-connect/token'  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials'  --data-urlencode 'client_id=mano-nfvo'  --data-urlencode 'client_secret=nKDcyoBL5GAhkmGJYLxPbytTUGeK1jtb' -s
----

copy the access_token from the response and use jwt.io to verify the token:
